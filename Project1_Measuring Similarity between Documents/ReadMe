In this assignment, we compared two approaches for obtaining the average Jaccard similarity among k number of nearest neighbors (in this case, k number of similar documents)â€”simple Brute Force (BF) and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). We changed variables such as data size (number of documents), k (number of nearest neighbors), r (number of rows in a band), and number of permutations, and compared the Jaccard similarity obtained by the two approaches.
