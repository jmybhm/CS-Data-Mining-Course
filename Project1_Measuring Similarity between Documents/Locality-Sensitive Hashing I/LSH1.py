'''Locality Sensitivy Hashing Part I
Laura Colbran and Jimin Yoo
Computes and prints the Jaccard similarity both exactly and by approximating it from a 
signature matrix. Prompts the user for the number of documents to read from a file, and 
for the ids of the two documents in question, and for the number of permutations to 
make for the signature matrix.
When naming doc ids, please make sure they're within the number of documents read!
We have much larger Jaccard similiarty estimation than the actual Jaccard similarity even with large permutation number
We ran some tests and suspect that is is because a and n are not relative primes (we still coded to take out some a/n  that are definitely not relative primes/
which made our results only slightly better)
data file name can be found in line 65.'''
